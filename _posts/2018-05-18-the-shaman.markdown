Raziel came about as a challenge to re imagine an existing character in a different way. This was a fun challenge for me because I had yet to try and sculpt wings. 

I started with a digital sketch up for the concept I was going for.

I was going for a organic creature who was stripped of clothing and armor and instead looked to be a weapon on itâ€™s own.

</p>

The first phase was finding a face and head that had the feel i was going for, scary and intelligent, I then fleshed out the basic shapes of the body and the wings. 
 I keep all my major anatomy on separate subtools and have several different versions to keep my work protected as I go.
