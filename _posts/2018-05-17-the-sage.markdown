The Sage is a personal favorite of mine. an original design I did for a comic book and video game project. I have worked on this character more than most and he has taken on a life of his own.

The Sage beckons the elements to aid him on his journey.

The first phase was finding a face and head that had the feel i was going for, scary and intelligent, I then fleshed out the basic shapes of the body and the wings. 
 I keep all my major anatomy on separate subtools and have several different versions to keep my work protected as I go.

Adding details like poly paint, textures and veins as well as my own alpha I made for his chest design. I used dragon teeth as a IMM brush to give Raziel all the spikes over his body.

Here is a sketch toy plastic material I tested out that gave a great gloss to the model and gave it a wet almost slimey look.

I Merge all of my subtools to begin the rigging and posing process.

Once rigged I will iterate several different poses until I find one that feels good and is balanced for 3D printing.

Here is the painted final product.
