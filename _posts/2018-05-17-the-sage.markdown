The Sage is a personal favorite of mine. an original design I did for a comic book and video game project. I have worked on this character more than most and he has taken on a life of his own.

The Sage Beckons the elements to aid him on his journey.

The first phase was finding a face and head that had the feel i was going for, scary and intelligent, I then fleshed out the basic shapes of the body and the wings. 
 I keep all my major anatomy on separate subtools and have several different versions to keep my work protected as I go.

Adding details like poly paint, textures and veins as well as my own alpha I made for his chest design. I used dragon teeth as a IMM brush to give Raziel all the spikes over his body.

Here is a sketch toy plastic material I tested out that gave a great gloss to the model and gave it a wet almost slimey look.

I Merge all of my subtools to begin the rigging and posing process.

Once rigged I will iterate several different poses until I find one that feels good and is balanced for 3D printing.

I did one 3D print bigger than my build volume and had to slice and key the wings to attach to the body separately. The other print pictured above was printed as one piece at max volume size 140mm x 140mm. 

I then prepped the model with white primer spray paint and after drying used a air brush to give the model a uniform color coat, and then used acrylic paint and a small detail brush to add the other colors by hand.
