Here is Venom I did within the Funko style. 

I started with a digital sketch up for the concept I was going for. I went through three iterations, before landing on this one and was please with how it came out.

The first phase was finding a face and head that had the feel i was going for, scary and intelligent, I then fleshed out the basic shapes of the body and the wings. 
 I keep all my major anatomy on separate subtools and have several different versions to keep my work protected as I go.
