          <p class="author_subtitle">Hi, My name is Brad Willner and I am local artist who dabbles in many things such as video games, comic books, animation and Toy design.
            </p>
            
            <p class="author_subtitle">I grew up in Bothell Washington and now have my own family living around Mill Creek.  
Ever since i was young I have been in love with toys, that love for toys has grown into passion and led me to want to become a professional toy maker. 
I am a father to two young boys and have spent the past 4 years raising them as a at home dad, all while practicing my craft and looking towards the future and getting back to work. 
I love being a father and a family man, it has taught me to be patient, caring, steady and dependable. 
              
               </p>

<p class="author_subtitle">I have been practicing Zbrush for a few years now focused primarily in character design. This last holiday I invested in my first 3D printer and have been steadily practicing and learning the in’s and out’s. I use a 
Flash Forge finder and use PLA as my material,it has been a great tool to start my journey into 3D printing.
  
  </p>

<p class="author_subtitle">My Goals are to get a job as a professional artist and work to create action figures and the toys of tomorrow. I have always been self motivated to create and become a better artist. 
I really want a opportunity to work with great artists who will, by proxy, pull the best out of me. 
I work well with others and I love to learn from those around me and am very humble in my process to take feedback and critiques of my work.
